## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Damon. 

I've been designing and engineering web solutions since 2007.

I enjoy working within the WordPress ecosystem (plugins, themes). I've been fortunate to work with several WordPress-centric agencies throughout my career, which allowed me to collaborate with some talented colleagues.

I've found myself working on some amazing projects for large companies, such as Microsoft, Uber, GoDaddy, Campbell's, Discovery Communications, REI and more.

I've contributed to [@WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress) core.

I currently have availability and would love to discuss your project needs.
